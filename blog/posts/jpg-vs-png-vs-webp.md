If you’ve ever asked yourself:

- *“Should I save as JPG or PNG?”*
- *“What is WebP, and should I be using it?”*
- *“Which format makes my website faster?”*

This guide is for you.

## 🖼️ Quick Answer

| Format | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|-------|---------|------|------|
| **JPG (JPEG)** | Photographs & real-life images | Small file size | Slight quality loss |
| **PNG** | Logos, text graphics, transparent images | Crisp + supports transparency | Bigger file size |
| **WebP** | Website images (modern performance) | **Smaller + sharper** | Older browsers may need fallback |

Now, let’s break down **when to use which** — and how to convert between them in seconds.

## 📷 **JPG (JPEG)** – Best for Photos & Real-Life Images

**Use JPG when your image is a photograph**, such as:

- Product photos
- Landscape images
- Portraits
- Social media pictures

Why JPG works here:

- It uses **lossy compression**, which removes unnoticeable detail.
- File sizes become **much smaller**, ideal for websites and email.

### Example:
A phone photo:
- Original: **6 MB**
- Compressed JPG: **500 KB**
- Looks **almost identical**, but loads 10× faster.

### ✅ If your image is a photo:  
**Use JPG.**

### Optional upgrade:
After exporting your JPG, make it even smaller (without quality loss) using:
➡️ **[Free Image Compressor](/compress)**

## 🎨 **PNG** – Best for Logos, Icons, & Transparency

**Use PNG when your image needs sharp edges or a transparent background.**

Perfect for:

- Company logos
- UI icons
- Stickers
- Screenshots
- Images with text

Why PNG works:

- It uses **lossless compression**, so **no detail is removed**
- Colors + lines stay **pin-sharp**
- It supports **transparent backgrounds**

### ❌ But…
PNG files are often **5–10× larger** than JPG.

A 200 KB JPG can easily be a 2 MB PNG.

### ✅ If your image needs transparency or sharp text:  
**Use PNG.**

### Convert JPG → PNG (for transparency workflows):
➡️ **[Convert Image Format](/convert)**

## ⚡ **WebP** – Best for Websites, SEO & Page Speed

WebP is a **modern image format** created by Google.

It supports:

- **Lossless & lossy compression**
- **Transparency (like PNG)**
- **High detail (like JPG)**
- **Much smaller file sizes**

### Typical results:
| Format | Size |
|--------|------|
| JPG | 500 KB |
| PNG | 1.5 MB |
| **WebP** | **200 KB** (same visual quality) |

This means faster:

- Page load times
- Core Web Vitals scores
- SEO performance
- User experience

### ✅ If you care about site speed (and SEO):  
**Use WebP.**

### Convert JPG/PNG → WebP instantly:
➡️ **[Image Converter](/convert)**

## 🧠 Which Image Format Should You Use? (Simple Decision Guide)

### **If your image is a photo → Use JPG**
Then compress it:
➡️ /compress

### **If your image has transparency or sharp text → Use PNG**
If size becomes large → convert to WebP:
➡️ /convert

### **If your website needs to load fast → Use WebP**
Convert everything except logos/special assets:
➡️ /convert

## 🎯 Real-World Examples

| Use Case | Best Format | Why |
|--------|------------|-----|
| Blog post photos | JPG → compress | Balanced size + quality |
| E-commerce product images | JPG → compress | Faster store loading = more sales |
| App icons, UI graphics | PNG | Clear edges + transparency |
| Logos on site hero banner | PNG or WebP | PNG for editing, WebP for live site |
| Whole website images | WebP | Best SEO + performance |

## 📈 Why This Matters for SEO

Google now uses **Core Web Vitals** as part of ranking.  
A site that loads slowly is **penalized**.

Images are usually the **single largest** component of page weight.

Converting images to WebP alone can reduce total load size by **60–90%**.

Faster load → better rankings → more traffic → more conversions.
